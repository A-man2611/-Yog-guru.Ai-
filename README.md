In today's digital world, and in light of the growing pandemic, many yoga instructors opt to teach online. However, even after learning or being trained by the best sources available, such as videos, blogs, journals, or essays, there is no live tracking available to the user to see if he or she is doing appropriately, which can lead to body posture issues and health issues later in life. Because existing technology isn't so far-fetched, kids have no means of knowing whether their position is good or terrible without the instructor's help. As a result, automatically assessing yoga postures is critical for yoga posture recognition and alert learners. The given model is a Web UI that will assist the user through yoga poses by live tracking them and correcting them on the fly. As a result, the method can be used as a starting point for creating a system that will help humans practise yoga with the help of a clever, inexpensive, and pretty awesome virtual yoga trainer
